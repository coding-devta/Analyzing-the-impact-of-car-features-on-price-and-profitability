## Problem Statement

1. The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars. 
2. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types and grades available to consumers. So it is very important to know which energy source will be profitable and will have more demand in the market for the manufacturer. 
3. It is very important to know which feature of the cars has more demand among the consumers. Without any proper insights into the driving factors of the consumer, the manufacturers can face losses in the market. 

To find the solution to the problems and identify the important features for pricing and profitability, I will perform data analysis from the provided data. This analysis will help the manufacturer to decide which feature they need to choose for car price and more profitability. It will also help the teams to have better visualizations of every driving factor for impact on a carâ€™s price and profitability.
